## Investigation of the Gapminder World Database

This is the second project I did for the completion of the [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program.

### Overview

This project analyses the Gapminder World Database for econmic (GDP per capita) and health related (life expectancy, child mortality, birth rate) differences across different continents. 

The processes applied include data wrangling, data cleaning, 1-D exploration of data, 2-D exploration of data as well as analysing the variables for correlation. 

### Technologies Used

- Python
- libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, functools, scipy
- the EDA is written in Jupyter Notebooks

### Key Findings

- development of GDP per capita shows increasing gap across continents with europe at the top and africa building the tail.
- life expectancy greatly improved in the last 100 years.
- the global average child mortality decreased by 93% from 1800 to 2018.
- birth rates differ greatly across different continents.
- a strong negative correlation between life expectancy and child mortality was found.
- a moderate positive correlation showed between GDP per capita and life expectancy.
